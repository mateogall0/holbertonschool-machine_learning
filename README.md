# Machine Learning SPE
This repository features all the projects of Holberton School's "machine learning SPE" done by Mateo Gallo from C#18.

All of these projects where done using Python and libraries like NumPY, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and many others.

## About Machine Learning
<p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on explicit instructions, machine learning systems use statical techniques to automatically learn patterns and relationships within the data.</p>
<p>The learning process involves the algorithm iteratively adjusting its parameters based on the input data, allowing the system to improve its performance over time. Machine learning is categorized into three main types:</p>

### Supervised learning
<p>The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is associated with the corresponding desired output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, making predicionts on new, unseen data.</p>

### Unsupervised learning
<p>The algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find patterns or structures within this data without explicit guidance. Common tasks include clustering similar data points or reducing the dimensionality of the data.</p>

### Reinforcement learning
<p>The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. It aims to discover the optimal actions to maximize cumulative reward over time.</p>
